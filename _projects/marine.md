MARINE stands for Monitoring Application for Conservation Area.
The purpose of this project is simple, to help beach conservation officer to monitor the area with more detail data and efficient in effort.
They need to monitor sea water condition because coral reefs is highly sensitive, 
when the condition of sea water drastically change they could made decision what action to take. 

Thanks to **Ministry of Higher Education and Technology Republic of Indonesia** for the grant for this project.

    <b>Left</b> is the first design of Marine; <b>Right</b> is actual form of Marine after adjustments.
    MARINE basically is box with sets of sensors (pH, temperature, and salinity) and camera inside. 
    Electricity for those components come from solar panel (on top of the box).
    To make it float on sea water we placed the box on top of buoy.
