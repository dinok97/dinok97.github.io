Haway is a combination of software (android application) and hardware in the form of a smart box containing a series of sensors and actuators to read environmental conditions at a sports venue. 
Haway's purpose is to increase sports participation in urban communities by informing sports venues along with detailed and real time data about the venue. 
Sports venues that we mention are open spaces such as city square, city parks, sport arenas and so on.
